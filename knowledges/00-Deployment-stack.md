The technology stack suitable for the Secure Multi-Layered SQL Injection Mitigation Framework includes the following components, selected for performance, scalability, security, and flexibility:[1]

***

### Security & Monitoring
- **SQLMap**: Automated SQL injection scanning and exploitation for dataset generation
- **Burp Suite**: Manual and automated penetration testing with detailed HTTP traffic analysis
- **OWASP ZAP**: Open-source scanning and fuzzing tool for testing web application vulnerabilities
- **iptables/netfilter**: Linux firewall and packet filtering for traffic control and honeypot network isolation
- **OpenVPN**: Secure encrypted communication channels between components
- **Splunk/QRadar**: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration for log aggregation and alerting

### Development & Machine Learning
- **Python 3.8+**: Primary development language for fast ML prototyping and system implementation
- **Go/C++**: Performance-critical detection components with low-latency processing
- **scikit-learn**: Classical machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, anomaly detection)
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks for CNN, LSTM, and hybrid ML models
- **TensorFlow Federated (TFF)**: Framework for privacy-preserving federated learning with differential privacy
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computation libraries

### Frontend & Visualization
- **React.js** or **Vue.js**: Component-based JavaScript frontend frameworks for building dashboard UI
- **D3.js**: Data-driven documents for advanced and interactive data visualizations
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional communication for live updating dashboards

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments and deployment
- **Kubernetes** or **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)**: Container orchestration for scalability and high availability
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Enterprise relational databases for knowledge base storage
- **SQLite**: Lightweight embeddable databases for honeypot systems
- **Apache Kafka** or **RabbitMQ**: Message queue systems supporting asynchronous communication between modules
- **Nginx** or **HAProxy**: Load balancing and reverse proxy to distribute traffic across detection engines and services
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Cloud infrastructure components (EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3) for reliable hosting and scaling
